Modified Ugly Trivia
======

A modified version of the code base used in [Legacy Code Retreat](http://legacycoderetreat.jbrains.ca) 
that we will use to practice legacy code refactoring.

We've already applied golden master testing (or characterization testing) to get a high test coverage of the code,
so that we can start refactoring it.
